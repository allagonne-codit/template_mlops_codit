## WHAT IS MLOPSðŸŽ¢?
MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices and methodologies that aim to streamline the deployment, management, and maintenance of machine learning models in production environments. It brings together the principles of DevOps (Development Operations) and applies them specifically to machine learning workflows. The MLOps lifecycle encompasses various stages and processes, ensuring the smooth integration of machine learning models into real-world applications.

## NEED FOR MLOPSðŸ”®?

Implementing MLOps practices is crucial for several reasons:

1. Reproducibility: MLOps ensures that the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment, is reproducible. This means that the same results can be obtained consistently, facilitating debugging, testing, and collaboration among team members.

2. Scalability: MLOps allows for the seamless scaling of machine learning models across different environments and datasets. It enables efficient deployment and management of models, regardless of the volume of data or the complexity of the infrastructure.

3. Agility: MLOps promotes agility by enabling rapid experimentation, iteration, and deployment of models. It facilitates quick feedback loops, allowing data scientists and engineers to adapt and improve models based on real-world performance and user feedback.

4. Monitoring and Maintenance: MLOps ensures continuous monitoring of deployed models, tracking their performance and detecting anomalies. It enables proactive maintenance, including retraining models, updating dependencies, and addressing potential issues promptly.

5. Collaboration: MLOps fosters collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the machine learning workflow. It establishes standardized practices, tools, and documentation, enabling efficient communication and knowledge sharing.
This project aims to implement the MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) lifecycle from scratch. The stages involved in the lifecycle include:


## MLOps STAGE
<details>
<summary>Data Management</summary>
Effective data management is crucial in MLOps. This stage involves data collection, preprocessing, and storage. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure data quality and consistency. Proper data versioning and tracking are implemented to maintain data integrity throughout the pipeline.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Model Training and Validation</summary>
This stage focuses on training machine learning models using the prepared data. It involves selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using suitable metrics. Cross-validation techniques are employed to assess model generalization and mitigate overfitting.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Model Deployment</summary>
Once a trained model is ready, it needs to be deployed in a production environment to serve predictions. This stage includes packaging the model with its dependencies, creating scalable and efficient APIs or services for model inference, and ensuring robustness, security, and scalability of the deployed model.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Monitoring and Logging</summary>
Continuous monitoring of deployed models is essential to ensure their performance, reliability, and adherence to predefined thresholds. This stage involves setting up monitoring systems to capture real-time metrics, detecting anomalies, and generating alerts when necessary. Logging is implemented to track model behavior, inputs, outputs, and any errors or exceptions.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Feedback Loop and Model Updates</summary>
MLOps embraces a feedback loop to gather user feedback, monitor model performance, and incorporate improvements. This stage involves analyzing user feedback, updating models based on new data, and implementing version control to manage model iterations effectively. Model updates are deployed seamlessly to maintain optimal performance.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Infrastructure and Resource Management</summary>
MLOps requires efficient management of computational resources, including cloud infrastructure, containers, and orchestration tools. This stage involves setting up scalable and automated infrastructure for model training, deployment, and monitoring. Infrastructure optimization and cost management strategies are employed to maximize efficiency.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Collaboration and Governance</summary>
Collaboration and governance play a vital role in MLOps. This stage involves establishing communication channels, version control, and documentation practices to foster collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. Governance frameworks are implemented to ensure compliance, ethical considerations, and responsible use of machine learning models.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Automated Testing and Continuous Integration/Deployment</summary>
Automated testing frameworks are crucial in MLOps to ensure the quality and reliability of the entire pipeline. This stage includes implementing unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests for data processing, model training, and deployment processes. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the integration, testing, and deployment of new features and updates.

## THIS PROJECT SCOPE

<details>
<summary>Business Scope</summary>
The first stage of the MLOps lifecycle is defining the business scope. This involves understanding the problem statement, identifying the goals and objectives of the project, and determining the success criteria. It is important to have a clear understanding of the business requirements before proceeding to the next stages.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Data Collection</summary>
In this stage, data relevant to the problem at hand is collected. This can involve gathering data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or external datasets. The data should be representative of the problem domain and sufficient for training and evaluating machine learning models.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Generating Synthetic Data</summary>
Sometimes, it may be necessary to generate synthetic data to supplement the existing dataset. Synthetic data can be created using techniques like data augmentation, simulation, or generation based on statistical models. This stage aims to enhance the dataset and provide additional training examples.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</summary>
EDA involves analyzing and visualizing the collected data to gain insights and understand its characteristics. This stage helps in identifying patterns, correlations, outliers, and missing values in the dataset. Exploring the data helps in making informed decisions regarding data preprocessing and feature engineering.

<details>
<summary>Feature Engineering</summary>
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used for training machine learning models. This stage includes techniques such as feature selection, feature extraction, and feature encoding. The goal is to create a set of informative and relevant features that capture the underlying patterns in the data.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Building End-to-End ML Pipeline</summary>
The ML pipeline is responsible for automating the workflow from data ingestion to model deployment. It consists of several stages, including data extraction, data versioning using DVC (Data Version Control), data ingestion, splitting the data into train and test sets, data transformation (imputation, scaling, encoding), model training using various algorithms (Adaboost, logistic regression, xgboost, lightgbm, random forest), hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation based on the roc_auc_score metric.
